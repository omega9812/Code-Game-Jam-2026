- Before adding new Unity systems or scripts, first locate and follow existing project patterns (namespaces, folder structure, input/animation/state handling) by searching/reading relevant scripts to avoid duplicating functionality.
- If required assets (sprites/audio/prefabs) are missing or not imported, create clearly named temporary placeholders (e.g., *_TEMP) and keep them isolated so they’re easy to replace later.
